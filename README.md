# banistmo_payment_plugin

The plugin is quite simple, it creates an appointment, and it is paid for using NMI (https://www.nmi.com/). It was created for a doctor working in Panama. After a few months, the website went offline. If someone needs to link NMI with Wordpress, well, I have experience with it.
